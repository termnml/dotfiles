The install-script in this dotfiles are meant for manjaro, so pacman and pamac should be available to install required packages.

Much love for i3.

Dotfiles are placed in this folder like in ```$HOME```

```bash
usage:
install.sh (-a|--all)
 - installs package
 - installs symlinks to configs
install.sh (-p|--packages)
 - installs packages
install.sh (-c|--configs)
 - installs symlinks to configs
```
